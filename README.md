# netbuster
#### Description
The program requires root privileges.

The program is adapted only for work in Linux environment.

It works on the basis of ARP spoofing, done without the use of third-party programs.

The program cannot be detected by **arpwatch** and similar software that controls the change of the ARP table on the GATEWAY side.

```

#### Run
```

// Disconnect the entire local network from the Internet.
// With scanning.
> python3 netbuster.py -i wlan0 -g 192.168.1.1

// Disable individual users.

```

**-i** or **--interface** [required] - your network interface.

**-g** or **--gateway** [required] - the gateway to which you are connected via the interface.

**-t** or **--target** - file with ip addresses, so as not to kill the entire subnet.
